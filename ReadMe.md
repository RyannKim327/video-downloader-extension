### Introduction
> This project is created for just making some random project, which looks like useful. The extension was just a follow-up idea, after re-creating an api to access, both `facebook` and `youtube` videos. And now, I've added more such as `9gag`, `reddit`, `tumblr`, `instagram`, `linkedin` and `tiktok`.

### Usage
> Just import this extension on your browser either `Chrome`, `Brave`, `Microsoft Edge`, or `Kiwi Browser (Mobile)`. For firefox, my apologies to disapoint you due to difficulties of creating extension for it, a reason why I was forced to download another browser for this. You may execute the layout by just clicking `CTRL + Shift + V` for the pop-up for desktop.
You also required to enable the clipboard permission for auto paste of the program.
